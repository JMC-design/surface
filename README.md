# surface
Generic functions for surfaces

This library is NOT meant to be :use'd.

You need to load a backend surface library to be able to use this, e.g. surface-x11, surface-x11-buffered, surface-fb, surface-raster, etc...

SURFACE:CREATE will get you a surface to use once a backend has been loaded.
